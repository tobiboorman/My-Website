			<h2> About Me </h2>
			<p> Welcome to my Website! I am a PhD student in Theoretical Condensed Matter Physics
			at the University of St Andrews working under the supervision of <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~bhb/">Dr Bernd Braunecker</a>. 
			My research is currently in the field of strongly correlated materials, specifically, on the novel dynamic behaviours that arise during the joint-coherent evolution of coupled systems at sub-thermal timescales.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Iâ€™m hoping to use this website as a catalogue of professional and personal projects, as well as to practice the art of website building.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			I received a 1<sup>st</sup> class MSci (Hons) in Theoretical Physics with Mathematics from Lancaster University in June 2020. In my spare time I enjoy reading, programming, going to classical concerts, visiting art galleries, and randomly walking into new hobbies, such as geocaching, cycling, postcard collecting, and crochet.

			<h2> About Me </h2>
			<p> Welcome to my Website! I am a final year PhD student in Theoretical Condensed Matter Physics
			at the University of St Andrews, working under the supervision of <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~bhb/">Dr Bernd Braunecker</a>. 
			My research concerns open system dynamics in strongly correlated quantum materials. To be specific, I am interested in examining the underlying mechanisms that drive memory effects between a quantum system and its environment, their resulting dynamical signatures, and the modulation of the latter subject to interactions within the environment.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			My long-term aim with this website is for it to act as a catalogue of personal and professional projects, as well as to gain some experience in building one from scratch. 
			</p>
			
			<p>
			I received a 1<sup>st</sup> class MSci (Hons) in Theoretical Physics with Mathematics from Lancaster University in June 2020. My project, titled <q>Many-Body Localisation Transitions in Disordered Quantum Systems Subject to Continuous Monitoring</q>, which was carried out under the supervision of Dr Alessandro Romito and Professor Henning Schomerus in collaboration with Dr Marcin Szyniszewski, won the Research Academy Prize <q>awarded in recognition of an outstanding research project in the graduating class of 2020</q>.
